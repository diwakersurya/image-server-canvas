# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Cloudflare Workers application is currently serving HTML content as plain text instead of properly rendered HTML. When users visit the root route, they see the raw HTML markup in the browser instead of a formatted webpage. This issue prevents users from properly accessing the greeting image generator interface and significantly impacts the user experience.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user visiting the root route, I want to see a properly rendered HTML webpage, so that I can interact with the greeting image generator interface.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user navigates to the root route ("/") THEN the system SHALL serve HTML content with the correct "text/html" content-type header
2. WHEN the HTML response is received by the browser THEN the browser SHALL render the HTML as a formatted webpage instead of displaying raw markup
3. WHEN the HTML page loads THEN all CSS styles SHALL be applied correctly
4. WHEN the HTML page loads THEN all JavaScript functionality SHALL work as expected

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the response headers to be properly preserved through the middleware chain, so that content-type headers are not overridden or lost.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN static HTML content is served THEN the content-type header SHALL remain "text/html; charset=utf-8" throughout the response pipeline
2. WHEN CORS headers are added to the response THEN the original content-type header SHALL be preserved
3. WHEN security headers are added to the response THEN the original content-type header SHALL be preserved
4. WHEN the final response is sent THEN all required headers SHALL be present without conflicts

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want all static assets (CSS, JavaScript) to load correctly, so that the webpage functions and appears as intended.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the HTML page requests CSS files THEN the system SHALL serve them with "text/css" content-type
2. WHEN the HTML page requests JavaScript files THEN the system SHALL serve them with "application/javascript" content-type
3. WHEN static assets are served THEN appropriate caching headers SHALL be applied
4. WHEN any static asset fails to load THEN the system SHALL return appropriate error responses

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper error handling for content serving, so that issues can be diagnosed and resolved quickly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN content serving fails THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information
2. WHEN an invalid path is requested THEN the system SHALL return a proper 404 response
3. WHEN content-type detection fails THEN the system SHALL fall back to a safe default
4. WHEN response creation fails THEN the system SHALL provide meaningful error messages
