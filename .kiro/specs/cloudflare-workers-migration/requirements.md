# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves migrating an existing Express.js application that generates greeting images to Cloudflare Workers. The current application uses Node.js-specific libraries like Canvas and Fabric.js to create dynamic images with GitHub user data. The migration needs to maintain the same functionality while adapting to the Cloudflare Workers runtime environment and its limitations.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to migrate the Express.js application to Cloudflare Workers, so that I can benefit from edge computing performance and Cloudflare's global network.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application is deployed to Cloudflare Workers THEN it SHALL serve the same endpoints as the original Express application
2. WHEN a user accesses the root endpoint THEN the system SHALL serve the HTML interface
3. WHEN the application runs on Cloudflare Workers THEN it SHALL not use any Node.js-specific APIs that are incompatible with the Workers runtime

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to generate greeting images via the `/image` endpoint, so that I can create personalized greeting cards with GitHub avatars.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user makes a GET request to `/image` THEN the system SHALL generate a greeting image with the specified parameters
2. WHEN query parameters are provided (user, avatarUrl, bg, w, h) THEN the system SHALL use those values to customize the image
3. WHEN no query parameters are provided THEN the system SHALL use default values
4. WHEN the image is generated THEN the system SHALL return it as a PNG image with appropriate content-type headers
5. WHEN the system generates the image THEN it SHALL include a random greeting message from the messages collection
6. WHEN the system generates the image THEN it SHALL include the GitHub user's avatar

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want to generate enhanced GitHub greeting images via the `/github` endpoint, so that I can create professional-looking greeting cards with GitHub profile information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user makes a GET request to `/github` THEN the system SHALL fetch GitHub user information via the GitHub API
2. WHEN GitHub user data is retrieved THEN the system SHALL generate an enhanced greeting image with gradient backgrounds
3. WHEN the image is generated THEN it SHALL include the user's GitHub username and profile information
4. WHEN the image is generated THEN it SHALL include decorative elements like gradients and styled text
5. WHEN the GitHub API request fails THEN the system SHALL handle the error gracefully

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to replace Node.js-specific canvas libraries with Cloudflare Workers-compatible alternatives, so that the image generation functionality works in the Workers runtime.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application runs on Cloudflare Workers THEN it SHALL use Workers-compatible image generation libraries instead of node-canvas
2. WHEN the application runs on Cloudflare Workers THEN it SHALL use Workers-compatible alternatives to Fabric.js for advanced image composition
3. WHEN image generation occurs THEN the system SHALL produce images with the same visual quality as the original implementation
4. WHEN the system generates images THEN it SHALL maintain the same image dimensions and layout as the original

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to serve static assets efficiently from Cloudflare Workers, so that the application provides fast loading times for CSS, JavaScript, and HTML files.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user requests static files (CSS, JS, HTML) THEN the system SHALL serve them with appropriate content-type headers
2. WHEN static files are served THEN they SHALL be cached appropriately for performance
3. WHEN the application serves static content THEN it SHALL maintain the same file structure and functionality as the original

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to configure the Cloudflare Workers deployment, so that the application can be easily deployed and managed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the migration is complete THEN the system SHALL include a wrangler.toml configuration file
2. WHEN the migration is complete THEN the system SHALL include updated package.json with Workers-compatible dependencies
3. WHEN the migration is complete THEN the system SHALL include deployment scripts and documentation
4. WHEN environment variables are needed THEN they SHALL be configured for the Workers environment
